### Explore US Bikeshare Data <small>(Python Programming for data science nano degree)</small>

### About the project
In this project, i used of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
